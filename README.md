# ListView-Android-
Android ListView is a view which groups several items and display them in vertical scrollable list. The list items are automatically inserted to the list using an Adapter that pulls content from a source such as an array or database. An adapter actually bridges between UI components and the data source that fill data into UI Component. Adapter holds the data and send the data to adapter view, the view can takes the data from adapter view and shows the data on different views like as spinner, list view, grid view etc. The ListView and GridView are subclasses of AdapterView and they can be populated by binding them to an Adapter, which retrieves data from an external source and creates a View that represents each data entry.
